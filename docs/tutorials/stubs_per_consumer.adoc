= Contracts on the producer side

In this tutorial we'll keep the contracts together with the producer code. Each consumer will
define the contracts in a dedicated folder.

== Tutorial

Consumer Driven Contract is like TDD on the layer of architecture. Let's start with writing a test on the
consumer side.

=== Consumer flow 1

- Congratulations! As consumers - we've successfully played around with the API of the producer both for
HTTP and messaging. Now we're filing a PR to their code with the proposal of contract and let's switch to

=== Producer flow 1

==== Updating contracts from the PR

- Now you would merge the PR to master and your CI system would build a fat jar and stubs
- Congratulations - you've completed the producer side of this tutorial
