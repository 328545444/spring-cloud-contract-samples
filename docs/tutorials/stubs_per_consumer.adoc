= Contracts on the producer side

In this tutorial we'll keep the contracts together with the producer code. Each consumer will
define the contracts in a dedicated folder. For the same requests the consumers will
expect different responses.

== Scenarios

We'll have to write the following features:

image::{images_folder}/scenario_stubs_per_consumer_1.png[title="Addresses unofficially the person by name for positive beer selling via HTTP"]

{nbsp}
{nbsp}

image::{images_folder}/scenario_stubs_per_consumer_2.png[title="Addresses unofficially the person by name for negative beer selling via HTTP"]

{nbsp}
{nbsp}

image::{images_folder}/scenario_stubs_per_consumer_3.png[title="Addresses officially the person by surname for positive beer selling via HTTP"]

{nbsp}
{nbsp}

image::{images_folder}/scenario_stubs_per_consumer_4.png[title="Addresses officially the person by surname for negative beer selling via HTTP"]

{nbsp}

== Flow

image::{images_folder}/flow.png[title="Consumer Driven Contract flow"]

== Tutorial

Consumer Driven Contract is like TDD on the layer of architecture. Let's start with writing a test on the
consumer side. This time we'll simulate in our single code base as if we had
two separate consumers. Normally both consumers would be having their own
codebases but for the sake of demo we'll try to keep things simple.

=== Consumer flow 1

image::{images_folder}/consumer_flow_1.png[title="Interact with cloned producer code"]

==== IDE setup

- Open in your IDE the `consumer_with_stubs_per_consumer` project (either via Maven or Gradle)
- We have the following objectives for HTTP
    * As a consumer with name `foo-service`
        ** for the client with certain `name` and `age` we'll ask the producer to verify whether
         the person is eligible to get the beer
        ** we expect to retrieve the `status` and the `name` of the client
        ** depending on the `status` we either accept or decline giving a beer
        ** since we're a friendly service we'll address the client by `MY DEAR FRIEND` statement
        and then use the person's `name`
        ** if the person (e.g. with name `marcin`) can get the beer then we say
         `THERE YOU GO MY DEAR FRIEND [marcin]`.
        ** otherwise we say `GET LOST MY DEAR FRIEND [marcin]`
    * As a consumer with name `bar-service`
        ** for the client with certain `name` and `age` we'll ask the producer to verify whether
         the person is eligible to get the beer
        ** we expect to retrieve the `status` and the `surname` of the client (for simplicity we will
        receive the provided `name` as `surname`)
        ** depending on the `status` we either accept or decline giving a beer
        ** since we're a very official service we'll address the client by `MR` statement
        ** if the person (e.g. with name `marcin`) can get the beer then we say
         `THERE YOU GO MR [marcin]`. Where `marcin` came back from the producer service
         as a `surname`.
        ** otherwise we say `GET LOST MR [marcin]`
- Normally we would be doing TDD but we already have some code ready to speed things up
- In the `BeerController` class you can see that the implementation of the method is missing -
we'll get back to that later. For now you can see that we have a `/beer` endpoint that expects a JSON
 request body that maps to a `Person` class
- Let's now open the `BeerControllerTest` and write the missing test bodies
+
[source,java]
----
include::{root}/consumer_with_stubs_per_consumer/src/test/java/com/example/BeerControllerTest.java[tags=impl]
----
- We need to name our consumer somehow. The best way will be to provide that value in the
`properties` attribute in `SpringBootTest` annotation (you could pass it also via a file
e.g. `application.yml`)
+
[source,java]
----
include::{root}/consumer_with_stubs_per_consumer/src/test/java/com/example/BeerControllerTest.java[tags=foo]
----
- If we run the tests obviously the tests will fail cause we have no implementation
- Now open the `BeerControllerForBarTest`. In this test class we'll simulate that we are the
`bar-service` and not the `foo-service`. Let's start with the missing test implementation
+
[source,java]
----
include::{root}/consumer_with_stubs_per_consumer/src/test/java/com/example/BeerControllerForBarTest.java[tags=impl]
----
- In this test we will not set the `spring.application.name` - we will change the name by an
attribute in an annotation later
- Now we'd want to write some implementation but the problem is such that we don't yet know what API
we would like to have... This is where we touch the very essence of Consumer Driven Contracts.
As consumers we want to drive the change of the API that's why, *as consumers*, we will work on the producer code.

==== Defining first `foo-consumer` HTTP contract

- Time to play with the API! Create a `src/test/resources/contracts/foo-consumer/rest`
 folder.
- You can define the contracts using Groovy DSL. Let's create our first HTTP contract.
  * Under the `rest` folder create a file `shouldGrantABeerIfOldEnough.groovy`
  * Call the `Contract.make` method to start defining the contract
+
[source,groovy]
----
org.springframework.cloud.contract.spec.Contract.make {

}
----

  * You can call `description()` method to provide some meaningful description.
+
TIP: You can use the
Groovy multiline String `""" """` to have all special characters escaped. Every new line in the String
will be converted into a new line character. Example
+
[source,groovy]
----
Contract.make {
	request {
		description("""
Represents a successful scenario of getting a beer

```
given:
	client is old enough
when:
	he applies for a beer
then:
	we'll grant him the beer
```
""")
}
----

  * Now call the `request { }` and `response { }` methods
+
[source,groovy]
----
org.springframework.cloud.contract.spec.Contract.make {
    description("""
        some interesting description
    """)
    request {
    }
    response {
    }
}
----

  * Let's assume that we're interested in sending a `POST` method. Call `method POST()` or `method "POST"`.
+
TIP: In Groovy you don't need to provide parentheses (in most cases). You can write either `method POST()`
  or `method(POST())`. In both cases it's the same syntax
+
[source,groovy]
----
org.springframework.cloud.contract.spec.Contract.make {
    description("""
        some interesting description
    """)
    request {
        method POST()
    }
    response {
    }
}
----
  * Now we need to provide some URL. Let it be `/check`. Let's write `url "/check"`
+
[source,groovy]
----
org.springframework.cloud.contract.spec.Contract.make {
    description("""
        some interesting description
    """)
    request {
        method POST()
        url "/check"
    }
    response {
    }
}
----
  * Now time to define some body. We'll leverage some of the Groovy power over here so if you're lost
  you can always check the http://groovy-lang.org/json.html[Groovy JSON documentation]. Let's call the
  `body()` method with brackets.
  * In Groovy you can use the map notation in such a way `[key: "value", secondKey: 2]`. In the same way
  we can describe the body of a JSON. So in order to send a JSON looking like this `{ "age": 22, "name": "marcin" }`
  we can create a map notation of `[age:22, name:"marcin"]`. The `body` method accepts a map and in Groovy
  if a method accepts a map then the `[]` brackets can be omitted. So you can either write
  `body([age:22, name:"marcin"])` or `body(age:22, name:"marcin")`.
  * Let us assume that we already want to be more generic about our contract and we want to verify
  that the age is greater than 20 and that name is any alphaunicode character. We can profit from the
  `$()` or `value()` methods that Spring Cloud Contract provides to define dynamic behaviour
  * We'll use the `$(regex(...))` method to define the age and the `$(anyAlphaUnicode())` for the name
+
[source,groovy]
----
org.springframework.cloud.contract.spec.Contract.make {
    description("""
Represents a successful scenario of getting a beer

```
given:
	client is old enough
when:
	he applies for a beer
then:

```
    """)
    request {
        method POST()
        url "/check"
        body(
                age: $(regex("[2-9][0-9]")),
                name: $(anyAlphaUnicode())
            )
    }
    response {
    }
}
----
  * Now time for the headers... Call the `headers { }` method
+
[source,groovy]
----
org.springframework.cloud.contract.spec.Contract.make {
    description("""
Represents a successful scenario of getting a beer

```
given:
	client is old enough
when:
	he applies for a beer
then:
	we'll grant him the beer
```
    """)
    request {
        method POST()
        url "/check"
        body(
                age: $(regex("[2-9][0-9]")),
                name: $(anyAlphaUnicode())
            )
        headers {

        }
    }
    response {
    }
}
----
  * Inside that method let's define that we want to use the `Content-Type: "application/json` header. Just
  call `contentType(applicationJson())` methods
+
[source,groovy]
----
org.springframework.cloud.contract.spec.Contract.make {
    description("""

            )
        headers {
            contentType(applicationJson())
        }
    }
    response {
    }
}
----
  * Congratulations! You defined how you would like the contract for the request to look like! Time for the
  response
  * In the `response` block we would like to define that that the status of our response will be 200.
  Just call `status 200`
+
[source,groovy]
----
org.springframework.cloud.contract.spec.Contract.make {
    description("""

given:

                name: $(anyAlphaUnicode())
            )
        headers {
            contentType(applicationJson())
        }
    }
    response {
        status 200
    }
}
----
  * We'd like our response to have some body. As you could have assumed there's a `body` method here too.
  We'll now use another way of defining bodies (which is the less preferred option in Spring Cloud Contract
  but still can be useful) - using String
  * We're assuming that we would like to send back a field called `status` that will return `OK` when the
  person can get the beer. The `foo-consumer` is also interested in getting back in the response
  the name from the request.
    ** To reference the request from response via JSON path you can call the `fromRequest()` method - (e.g. for referrencing the
    `name` field from request) - `fromRequest().body('$.name')"
    ** In Groovy when doing the multiline string `""" """` you can call the `${}` interpolation
    mechanism to call a method from within a String.
+
TIP: Don't mix the `$()` from Spring Cloud Contract with `${}` interpolation mechanism
  * Call the `body(""" { "status" : "OK", "name": "${fromRequest().body('$.name')}" } """)`.
  That way you're defining how the response body will look like by providing the exact JSON value,
  and inside that JSON you also provide dynamic values. In our case for the `name` response field
  we'll provide the value of `name` from the request

  * Congratulations! You have created your first contract!

==== Defining second `foo-consumer` HTTP contract

- Time for you to create the second contract. Create a file called `shouldRejectABeerIfTooYoung.groovy`.
If you're lost just check out the <<_foo_consumer_contracts,solution>>
  * Set the `age` in the request to regular expression `[0-1][0-9]`
  * Update the response body to return a `status` equal to `NOT_OK`.
  * Update the description

==== Defining `bar-consumer` HTTP contracts

- Let's now move to the `bar-consumer`. Let's create a `src/test/resources/contracts/bar-consumer/rest`
 folder.
- We'll create very similar contracts to the `foo-consumer` one. The only difference is that
the response will contain a `surname` field instead of a `name` field
- Go ahead and create 2 files `shouldGrantABeerIfOldEnough.groovy` and `shouldRejectABeerIfTooYoung.groovy`
and fill them out! <<_bar_consumer_contracts,Or copy from the solution>>
- We've written the contracts - time to publish some stubs!

include::snippets/setting_plugin_on_clone.adoc[]

==== Writing missing implementation on the consumer side

- We know what the API should look like.
Let's go to `BeerController` and write the missing implementation <<_stubs_per_consumer_beercontroller,or copy from the solution>>
    * We want to send a POST HTTP method to `http://localhost:8090/check`
    * The JSON body will be the `Person` that we've received in the controller
    * depending on the status (`OK` or `NOT_OK`) we'll send back
      ** for `OK`: `THERE YOU GO ` + the result of the `message(body of the response)` method
      ** for `NOT_OK`: `GET LOST ` + the result of the `message(body of the response)` method
- If we run the `BeerControllerTest` and `BeerControllerForBarTest` - they will both fail due
to connection refused. Let's fix that!

==== Turning on Stub Runner in consumer tests

- Since we have managed to install the stubs locally and now we've got the missing implementation
written - let's now go back to the consumer tests
- Let's add the Spring Cloud Contract Stub Runner as a dependency
include::snippets/consumer_stub_runner_dep.adoc[]

- Let's check out the `BeerControllerTest` and add the Stub Runner functionality
+
[source,java]
----
@AutoConfigureStubRunner(workOffline = true,
		ids = "com.example:beer-api-producer-with-stubs-per-consumer",
		stubsPerConsumer = true)
----
  * You can see that we've turned on the `stubsPerConsumer` flag - that means that the path
  of stubs is scanned and only those that contain the value of `spring.application.name`
  will get picked
- Now let's run the test and it should pass!
- Let's try to fix the `BeerControllerForBarTest`. We don't want to set the
`spring.application.name` - that's why we'll set that name on the `@AutoConfigureStubRunner`
annotation via the `consumerName` property (of course we also have to turn on the
`stubsPerConsumer` flag)
+
[source,java]
----
@AutoConfigureStubRunner(workOffline = true,
		ids = "com.example:beer-api-producer-with-stubs-per-consumer",
		stubsPerConsumer = true,
		consumerName = "bar-consumer")
----

Congratulations! As consumers - we've successfully played around with the API of the producer both for
HTTP and messaging. Now we're filing a PR to their code with the proposal of contract and let's switch to
the producer side.
