==== IDE setup

include::consumer_ide_setup.adoc[]

- The problem is such that we don't yet know what API we would like to have... This is where we touch
 the very essence of Consumer Driven Contracts. As consumers we want to drive the change of the API
 that's why, *as consumers*, we will work on the producer code.

include::setup_cloned_producer.adoc[]

==== Defining first HTTP contract

- Time to play with the API! Create a `src/test/resources/contracts/beer/rest` and
 `src/test/resources/contracts/beer/messaging` folders. (<<_proposal_of_simple_contracts_by_consumer,Show solution>>)

 TIP: It's good practice to create also a folder for a consumer. So if your consumer's
 application name is `foo-service` then you could create a
 `src/test/resources/contracts/foo-service/beer/rest` and
  `src/test/resources/contracts/foo-service/beer/messaging` folders. You'll be able to read
  more about this in the tutorial related to the `stubs per consumer` feature.

==== Defining second HTTP contract

- Time for you to create the second contract. Create a file called `shouldRejectABeerIfTooYoung.groovy`.
If you're lost just check out the <<_proposal_of_simple_contracts_by_consumer,solution>>
  * Set the `age` in the request to `17`
  * Update the response body to return a `status` equal to `NOT_OK`.
  * Update the description

==== Defining first messaging contract

- Ok we've done the case for HTTP. Let's move to the `src/test/resources/contracts/beer/messaging` folder

include::first_messaging_contract.adoc[]
* Congratulations! You've created your first messaging contract!

==== Defining second messaging contract

- Time for you to create the second contract. Create a file called `shouldSendRejectedVerification.groovy`.
If you're lost just check out the <<_proposal_of_simple_contracts_by_consumer,solution>>
  * Set the `eligible` in the response body to `false`
  * Update the label to `rejected_verification`
  * Update the description

==== Setting up the Spring Cloud Contract plugin on the producer side

- Ok, at this moment we've described the API that would be interesting for us, consumers, and most likely
will suit our needs. We define those contracts cause we want to have some stubs produced for us without
needing to write a single line of the implementation code. The tool that we need to do this conversion
is the Spring Cloud Contract plugin. Let's add it to the producer's `pom.xml` / `build.gradle`.

[source,xml,indent=0,subs="verbatim,attributes",role="primary"]
.Maven
----
<plugin>
    <groupId>org.springframework.cloud</groupId>
    <artifactId>spring-cloud-contract-maven-plugin</artifactId>
    <version>${spring-cloud-contract.version}</version>
    <extensions>true</extensions>
</plugin>
----
+
[source,groovy,indent=0,subs="verbatim,attributes",role="secondary"]
.Gradle
----
buildscript {
	dependencies {
		classpath "org.springframework.cloud:spring-cloud-contract-gradle-plugin:${verifierVersion}"
	}
}
----
  * The coordinates of the plugin are: `org.springframework.cloud:spring-cloud-contract-gradle-plugin:${version}`
  * For this tutorial we're using latest snapshot versions that you can reference via the Maven's
  `${spring-cloud-contract.version}` property or Gradle's `verifierVersion` one
  * Once the plugin has been added just call the commands to install the stubs locally
+
[source,bash,indent=0,subs="verbatim,attributes",role="primary"]
.Maven
----
$ ./mvnw clean install -DskipTests
----
+
[source,bash,indent=0,subs="verbatim,attributes",role="secondary"]
.Gradle
----
$ ./gradlew clean build publishToMavenLocal -x test
----
  * Now you can check out `target/stubs/META-INF/com.example/beer-api-producer/0.0.1-SNAPSHOT` for Maven or
  `build/stubs/META-INF/com.example/beer-api-producer/0.0.1-SNAPSHOT` for Gradle. Over there you'll see
  `contracts` folder where all contracts got copied and the `mappings` folder where you'll find all the
  generated stubs. By default Spring Cloud Contract uses http://wiremock.org[WireMock] as an implementation
  of fake HTTP server. Under the `beer/rest` subfolder you'll see all the generated stubs. Notice that
  we're using JSON Paths to check the contents of the request.
